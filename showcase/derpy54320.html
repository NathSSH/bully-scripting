			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>
				Hiya! This is my personal little page for sharing my published mods.<br/>
				I hope you have fun and enjoy playing, or even just learning a little bit about the history.<br/>
				You can find most of my mods on my <a href="https://www.mediafire.com/folder/uf6hng3ahi8to/Bully_Mods">MediaFire</a>,
				as only a few will be arbitrarily listed here.

			<h1>Insanity Edition</h1>
			<p>
				There were so many times as a modder that I would just sloppily make a script that makes everyone act crazy.
				Make people fight each other, make them do random things. Whatever. I remember calling it lots of different things every time I did this, but I never released it.
				That is until one day... SWEGTA started a video series called <a href="https://youtu.be/2SkzYraghGc">Insanity Edition</a>.
				The perfect time to deploy my madness upon the world was finally here. I put all my ideas from all my previous crazy mods together and made a new script from scratch.
				Over the course of this video series, I kept updating the script with new random or insane additions.
				My favorite part about this mod is that I never had to say "no I can't do that, it wouldn't be stable" - instead I just said "fuck it, it's insanity edition".
				Maybe that's why it's a horrible crashy mess, but maybe it's part of the charm. The only design rule the mod had was "affect the world, not the player".
			</p>
			<p>
				Anyways, the latest version is 3.1 (<a href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/oz64xtz490rx8ds/insanity_edition_3.1.zip/file">download</a>).
				Oh and while we're on the topic, yes I told SWEGTA to wait on the videos so I could make some over the top ending.
				I have no idea what I was really thinking, but even though I gave them the go-ahead to start it again without any additions we just lost too much momentum.
				Maybe some day version 4 will see the light of day.

			<h1>Fight Club</h1>
			<p>
				Fight Club is still one of my personal favorite mods of mine.
				This mod started with a simple enough concept, spawn a bunch of bad guys until you couldn't keep up anymore.
				With enough time I really took a "everything but the kitchen sink" approach and just kept throwing nonsense into the store.
				At first in version 1.0 (<a href="https://youtu.be/ar0l5TKZjH0">video</a>) you could only fight in the gym.
				In 2.0 there was a lot more content, along with a bunch new maps. Then after some bug fixes,
				version 2.3 (<a href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/tkhom40pctrwha0/Fight_Club.rar/file">download</a>) was released.
				Have fun and good luck getting a good score, I suggest playing on hard as it has the best balancing.

			<h1>Super Mod</h1>
			<p>
				TL;DR: download <a href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/9bjefe4d61hh1s4/Super_Mod_3.zip/file">Super Mod 3</a> as it's the best version.
			</p>
			<p>
				Super Mod is my oldest mod besides a simple little (lost-to-time) player selector.
				It all started with my first release of version 0.5 (<a href="https://youtu.be/jGH-eJTh5B0">video</a>) which was my first sloppy attempt at just getting something cool out there.
				Then after enough polish I was happy enough to call it version 1.0 (<a href="https://youtu.be/WCOQK5XzAzs">video</a>).
				A while after that I knew I had to innovate. I wanted to make it look pretty.
				I still remember obsessing about how cool it looked the first time I got it, and even though it's just a few linebreaks this was amazing.
				Finally version 2.0 (<a href="https://youtu.be/wHu9DLun6kc">video</a>) was written from scratch with the brand new menu system released pretty quickly.
				After a large enough amount of drama relating to not being "allowed" to release the source to these mods under the threat of admins, these versions were all lost besides for their videos.
			</p>
			<p>
				Within about a year of starting version 0.5, the biggest and best version was finally made:
				version 3.0 (<a href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/9bjefe4d61hh1s4/Super_Mod_3.zip/file">download</a> / <a href="https://youtu.be/dQK8WMu3-zI">video</a>).
				This one I put my whole heart and soul into, and it seems to have paid off with ~75,000 downloads on MediaFire alone within the last ~9 years.
				If you count the downloads it had on all other sites and re-uploads, it would probably be closer to double.
				All this looking back just to say, thankyou.
			</p>
			<p>
				A little less than a year later I decided I wanted to try again. Do something more ambitious.
				I had this quirky idea of making a more "general" mod menu that could be added onto with plugins. I wanted some community driven effort to just add a bunch to this one menu.
				Although it seemed like a cool idea at the time, it (unsurprisingly looking back) was a huge bust. Apparently releasing a mod with less features than the old version is a pretty dumb idea.
				Regardless though, version 4.0 (<a href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/zfo9bigedceqrh9/Super_Mod_4.rar/file">download</a>) was released.

			<h1>Fly</h1>
			<p>
				I really deserve a reward for coming up with this name. In Fly, you can basically fly around.
				This mod was made for you to get out of bounds, and also for developers to get what position the player or the movable free-camera is in.
				There's also a fun little feature where you can shoot rubber band balls where the free-camera is looking.
				Oh and don't forget you can warp to just about any area / interior with it!
				I don't remember much about the history, but the current version is 3 (<a href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/9mrer7nllut25uy/fly3.zip/file">download</a>).
