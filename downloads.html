			<h1 id="dsl">derpy's script loader</h1>
			<p>
				derpy's script loader (DSL) is a script loader for Bully: Scholarship Edition (PC).
				It aims to take away all of the hassle and limitations that used to come with scripting the game.<br/>
				For more information, see the <a href="/dsl/about.html">about page</a> and be sure to read the <dfn>readme.txt</dfn> that comes with the download.
				Also check out <a href="https://discord.gg/r6abc7Avpm">the discord</a> to stay updated, share mods, and ask questions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Versions with an <b>S</b> do not have any <i>system access</i> functionality.
				Although these features are off by default and the user must explicitly enable it in their config,
				non-S versions may still trip anti-virus software and are only recommended if you know what you're doing.
			</p>
			<p>
				The current client version is <a href="https://www.mediafire.com/file_premium/re476dgmxsimp6e/derpy_script_loader_9_s.zip/file">derpy's script loader 9 - S</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The current server version is <a href="https://www.mediafire.com/file_premium/vobshxqcc2kxxa8/derpy_script_server_9_s.zip/file">derpy's script server 9 - S</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you need some other version, see <a href="https://www.mediafire.com/folder/clgtvlrnat179/derpy's_script_loader">all versions</a>.
			</p>
			<h1 id="lua">Lua 5.0.2</h1>
			<p>
				Bully uses <a href="https://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.0.2.tar.gz">Lua 5.0.2</a> with <dfn>LUA_NUMBER</dfn> set as a 4 byte floating point,
				and a few other differences that don't affect the way you'd compile or run scripts.<br/>
				You can download a pre-compiled binary for the <a href="/downloads/luac.exe">compiler</a>
				and stand-alone <a href="/downloads/lua.exe">interpreter</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Both of these tools are <i>command line tools</i> made for Windows, meaning they will only run using Windows' command prompt.
				If you don't know how to use the command prompt, consider checking out the <a href="/tutorials/1_introduction.html">tutorial</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can run <span class="sample_input">luac.exe</span> without passing any arguments to get the help dialogue.<br/>
				The most common usage looks like <span class="sample_input">luac -o ArcRace1.lur source.lua</span>, which will compile <dfn>source.lua</dfn> into <dfn>ArcRace1.lur</dfn>.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can run <span class="sample_input">lua.exe</span> by itself to run Lua in <i>interactive mode</i>, letting you write code that gets instantly executed.<br/>
				You can also run a script by doing something like <span class="sample_input">lua script.lua</span>, where <dfn>script.lua</dfn> is the script you want to run.
