			<h1>Raw Dumps</h1>
			<p>
				This section is for people who just want raw data pulled from the game without the extra fuss,
				and also for all the stuff that has not been properly documented in the other sections yet.
				In most cases data here was pulled from game files or game memory using a variety of techniques.
				Generally, most stuff here will not be touched up aside from basic sorting.
