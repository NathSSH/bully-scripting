			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>
				Hiya, welcome to my Bully script modding tutorial.
				This tutorial is designed to help you go from knowing nothing about Lua scripting to making your own mods.
				For each section, an example will be provided as well as some exercises for you to help make sure you understand the section.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this section, your main task will be to get a custom script running in-game.
				There are <b>two</b> ways to make script mods, so feel free to skip to the one you are interested in.
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Scripts.img</b>: your mods will replace the game's normal scripts by modifying the <i>Scripts.img</i> file.</li>
					<li><b>derpy's script loader (DSL)</b>: your mods will use my script loader to run custom scripts (recommended).</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<h1>Scripts.img Modding</h1>
			<p>
				For a long time, this was the only way to make a script mod.
				Sometimes it is the better option for a mod, but it is often times just more hassle nowadays.
			</p>
			<p>
				First let's pick up some tools.
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/"><b>Notepad++</b></a>: the recommended program for making your Lua scripts.</li>
					<li><a href="/downloads/luac.exe"><b>luac.exe</b></a>: a custom Lua 5.0.2 compiler compiled to use similar settings to Bully.</li>
					<li><a href="/downloads/img.exe"><b>img.exe</b></a>: a basic IMG tool for Bully, though a bit dated it is still often the simplest.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<h2>Picking a Script</h2>
			<p>
				You could replace any script in the game with your own, but only the 2 most common choices will be covered here.
				<ul>
					<li><b>ArcRace1.lur</b>: a popular choice due to it being easily started by playing the arcade machine in the Boy's dorm.</li>
					<li><b>STimeCycle.lur</b>: another popular choice due to it being the simplest script that runs non-stop.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<h2>First ArcRace1.lur Script</h2>
			<p>
				For your first ArcRace1.lur mod, we'll make a simple script that gives 
			</p>
			<code class="data_dump">
				<button class="copy_code" onclick="copyCode(this)">copy</button>
				<pre></pre>
