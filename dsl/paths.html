			<h1>derpy's script loader - Relative Paths</h1>
			<p>
				Many DSL functions will take something known as a <i>relative path</i>.
				This means that the path you give is relative to the running collection, or the game's <dfn>Scripts</dfn> folder if a DSL is not running (meaning the function was called from a base game script).
				For example you request a file named <dfn>file.txt</dfn> from a normal collection named <dfn>Collection</dfn>,
				then the real path used will end up being something like <dfn>_derpy_script_loader/scripts/Collection/file.txt</dfn>.
			</p>
			<hr/>
			<h1>File Security</h1>
			<p>
				If system access is not enabled (see <dfn>allow_system_access</dfn> in DSL's config), then an error will occur when trying to access a file that is not in a "safe" path.
				Anywhere in DSL's <dfn>scripts</dfn> folder and <dfn>packages</dfn> folder is considered safe, but in general you shouldn't be accessing anything outside of your own collection.
			</p>
			<hr/>
			<h1>Zip Files</h1>
			<p>
				If the running collection is a <i>zipped</i> collection, then the file is retrieved from the zip archive.
				In this case, there is no way to refer to a file that is not in said zip archive.
