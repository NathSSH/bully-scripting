				Set to the current <a href="/dsl/about.html#versions">version of DSL</a>.

				You can use this value to conditionally support certain features of DSL,
				or to check for the presence of DSL when making a script that should work anywhere.
			</p>
			<p>
				This value <i>does</i> actually refer to the full version number.
				This means if you're running a version like <b>7.1</b>, this value will actually be <b>7.1</b> and <i>not</i> just <b>7</b>.

			<h2 id="dsl">dsl</h2>
			<p>
				<span class="dsl_version">DSL7</span> This feature was introduced in version 7.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <dfn>dsl</dfn> table can be used to get shared tables from script collections that
				used <a href="/dsl/library/manager.html?GetScriptSharedTable">GetScriptSharedTable</a>.
				A shared table can be retrieved by indexing <dfn>dsl</dfn> using the desired script collection's name (case-insensitive).
				If the collection does not exist, is shutting down, or isn't sharing its table then you will get <b>nil</b>.
				You should not set values in <dfn>dsl</dfn>.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you are making network scripts, it is suggested you use the <a href="#net">net</a> table instead
				since the <dfn>dsl</dfn> table does not differentiate between local and network scripts.
				This would mean that a table from a local script could override the one you may expect from a network script.
			</p>
			<p>
				Usually you should only use <dfn>dsl</dfn> instead of <dfn>net</dfn> if you are not making network scripts.
			</p>
			<h2 id="net">net</h2>
			<p>
				<span class="dsl_version">DSL8</span> This feature was introduced in version 8.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <dfn>net</dfn> table behaves very similarly to the <dfn>dsl</dfn> table,
				but it gets tables from <a href="/dsl/library/manager.html?GetScriptNetworkTable">GetScriptNetworkTable</a> instead.
				Only network scripts (client scripts from a server or main scripts on a server) can make these tables,
				so it helps ensure that network scripts have their own "namespace" independent from local scripts.
			</p>
			<p>
				When making client network scripts, it is suggested you use <dfn>net</dfn> instead of <dfn>dsl</dfn>.
				Although server scripts can't have naming conflicts like the client can, using <dfn>net</dfn> will still make your code more consistent.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sometimes it may seem more tempting to just make a global function or put a value in <dfn>shared</dfn>,
				but using a shared table from <dfn>dsl</dfn> is often the better choice for a few reasons.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>It naturally creates a namespace for each mod (since you must do <dfn>dsl.modname</dfn>), so function names will never conflict with other mods.</li>
				<li>The presence of a shared table can be tested for by checking if <dfn>dsl.modname</dfn> is <b>nil</b>, allowing simple conditional usage of shared functions from other mods.</li>
				<li>Tables from <dfn>dsl</dfn> are <i>only</i> accessible while the collection is running, which ensures shared functions can only be called when the mod they came from is running.</li>
				<li>It is DSL's standard way of sharing functions between multiple script collections, so using it will make your mod more consistent with other scripts and official DSL scripts.</li>
