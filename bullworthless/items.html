			<h1>Faction Items</h1>
			<p>
				Items are desired by different factions.
				This is how factions are scored at the end of the school year.
				Each faction has 5 <i>unique</i> items, and 1 <i>common</i> item.
				They will really want to get all their unique items, but still get as many common items as they can.
			</p>
			<p>
				A faction's <i>score</i> is calculated using <b>(unique_count / 5) * common_count</b>.
				This means a faction's common item is their main scoring method, but since it is multiplied by their unique items they will want them all.
			</p>
			<p>
				All faction items are in the <a href="#items">full list of items</a>.
				The descriptions given here are what shows up in the faction item menu, explaining why the item is important to the faction.
