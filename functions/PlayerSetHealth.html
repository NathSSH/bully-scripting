<p class="func_description">
	Sets the player's health.
	Health can go as high as you want, but it is only meant to go to double the max health (that extra health being from the kissing bonus).<br/>
	Unlike <a href="/function.html?PedSetHealth">PedSetHealth</a>, this function will not change the player's max health if health is set higher.
	By default, the player's max health is 200.
