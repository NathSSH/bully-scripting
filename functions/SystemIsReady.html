<p class="func_description">
	Checks if the game is ready for most forms of scripting.<br/>
	This is very important in any script that runs as soon as the game starts, and you should wait until it returns true before doing most things.
	In a few cases, you may find it necessary to wait an additional second after the system is ready.
</p>
<h2>Arguments</h2>
<p class="func_arguments">
	None.
</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<ul class="func_results">
	<li class="lua_boolean">System ready state</li>
</ul>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>Wait for the system to be ready before any other code.</p>
<code class="func_example">
	<button class="copy_code" onclick="copyCode(this)">copy</button>
	<pre>while not SystemIsReady() do
	Wait(0)
end
-- actual stuff you want to do here</pre>
</code>
<p>Move the player outside when it is safe to do so.</p>
<code class="func_example">
	<button class="copy_code" onclick="copyCode(this)">copy</button>
	<pre>if not SystemIsReady() then -- check if we need to wait for the system at all (won't be the case if the script started late)
	repeat
		Wait(0)
	until SystemIsReady() and AreaIsLoading()
	Wait(1000) -- an extra second for safety
end
while AreaIsLoading() do -- in case the area started switching during the wait, or was already switching without the wait
	Wait(0)
end
